## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 11, part-1 
This was one of my favorites because it took me and my partner a very long time to debug and make it pass all the tests.  I was able to use object-oriented programming to rewrite lab 10 part-2. It was a lot of pain to figure out why the stoi() and stod() did not work, but once I figured it out it was the first row of headers in the csv file, which caused the problem, the solution was shockingly simple, yet it took so long for me to finish.  It was very challenging for me, but a great learning experience.


Lab 5, part-1 
This was also fun as it requires us to calculate the area of a rectangle. I learned how to use functions better and had a very easy time writing the function, then calling that function to calculate. It felt like magic, and it was very satisfying to see all the tests passed. We also ran into a problem where we had problems with github, and unable to push the codes, the problem was resolved by a git pull command, and in the end we just uploaded the files directly onto the github depository.


Lab 2
madlib.cc was always one of my favorites because it was at the early stage of my understanding of C++. I got to use my limited knowledge of the language to print out words. There were only simple std::cin and std::cout commands, but It felt great as I was doing it in a totally new language. The feeling was just like the first time I print out “Hello World” on Python or C#.
